title: "mPose: Reconstructing 3D Skeleton Posture using mmWave Signals"
content: "We propose a wireless skeleton posture reconstruction system, mPose, which can continuously monitor
                    the user’s upper body skeleton (e.g., head, neck, torso, and arms) postures by using a low-cost, COTS mmWave sensor. 
                    Particularly, mPose extracts spatial features associated with the user’s body movements from sensor data. It employs a CNN
                    to derive the relationship between spatial features and skeleton coordinates captured by a camera. Extensive experiments using the TI AWR1642-ODS mmWave 
                    sensor are conducted with three participants and various postures. We show that mPose could accurately reconstruct the user’s 
                    upper skeleton postures with only 1.9° overall angular error."
